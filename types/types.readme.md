#What is a type?
Easy way to refer to the different properties + functions that a value has

###Value
Anything we can assign to a variable - strings, numbers, booleans, null, functions, classes,arrays ...

####Example
"red" - Its a string 0 It is a value that has all properties and methods that we assume a string has.

1 - Its a string 0 It is a value that has all properties and methods that we assume a number has.

In typescript we have two categories of types:
- Primitive Types: number, boolean, void, undefined, string, symbol, null
- Object Types: functions, arrays, classes, objects

###Why do we care about types?
- Types are used by the Typescript compiler to analyze our code for errors
- Types allow other engineers to understand what values are flowing around our codebase
